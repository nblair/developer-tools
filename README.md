# Developer Tools

This is a collection of (questionably?) useful libraries supporting
my and my team's software development.

### preauth-simulation filter

[preauth-simulation filter](preauth-simulation filter) includes a Java Servlet
Filter that lets a developer spoof Pre-Authentication environments (Shibboleth, SiteMinder) locally
without having to install them on their workstation.

### spring-profile-conditional-filter

[spring-profile-conditional-filter](spring-profile-conditional-filter) gives you the means
to conditionally activate a Java Servlet Filter if and only if one or more Spring Profiles
are active.
